One Jamam
---------
144 minutes = 02Hrs 24Mins

12 hrs = 5 Jamam
24 hrs = 10 Jamam

Each pakshi, will do any of the mentioned activities for 144 minutes i.e for 02hrs 24mins.
No two bird will do the same activity at the same time and the activity is called "Main Activity", when they do it for one continuous jamam i.e. 144 minutes

For every activity in progress, there will be 5 "Sub Activities" performed by the birds.
Once again, now two bird within the sub-activity phase, will do the same "sub-activity"

Generally favourable period
---------------------------
Ruling ( Main Activity )

4 favourable & favourable periods
---------------------------------
Ruling ( sub activity ) in Ruling ( main activity )
Eating ( sub activity ) in Ruling ( main activity )

Ruling ( sub activity ) in Eating ( main activity )
Eating ( sub activity ) in Eating ( main activity )

Most Effective & Favourable period
----------------------------------
Ruling ( sub activity ) in Ruling ( main activity )

Active / In active for the entire day
-------------------------------------
For any given day, only one specific bird may/may not be "Active" for the entire day.

Likewise, for any given day, only one specific bird may/may not be "In Active" for the entire day
In this case, we may look at the bird's friends

Friends / Foes
--------------
When a bird is not 'Ruling' or 'Eating', that period will be unfavourable.
In such cases, we need to look at the bird's friends, who are currently doing 'Ruling' or 'Eating' activity and consider those period.
However, the bird's friends will have foes and they should be performing lesser potent activity than that of the them.
Eg:
Crow; Foes = cock, vulture

Like wise, When a bird's enemies are stonger than our bird, then, our bird will be rendered in effective.
Eg:
Our Bird = Crow; Foes = Owl, Peacock
If Owl is "Ruling" and Crow is "Eating", then Crow will be rendered in effective.
